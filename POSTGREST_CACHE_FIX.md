# PostgREST Schema Cache Fix

## ❌ Problem
Error: `could not find public.drugs in schema cache`

This means PostgREST (Supabase's REST API layer) hasn't loaded the `drugs` table into its internal cache, so it can't serve API requests for it.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### What We Did

1. **Forced Schema Reload**
   - Added/removed temporary column (triggers immediate reload)
   - Updated table comments with timestamp
   - Sent `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'` signals

2. **Verified Permissions**
   - Granted SELECT to `anon` and `authenticated` roles
   - Updated default privileges
   - All tables have proper grants: ✅

3. **Refreshed RLS Policies**
   - Recreated policies for drugs, programs, drugs_programs
   - All policies allow public SELECT access: ✅

### Database Status ✅

- **drugs table**: 10 rows, RLS enabled, 1 policy
- **programs table**: 40 rows, RLS enabled, 1 policy
- **drugs_programs table**: 13 rows, RLS enabled, 1 policy
- **Ownership**: postgres (correct)
- **Grants**: PUBLIC:SELECT, anon:SELECT, authenticated:SELECT (correct)

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Files Created

1. **`test-postgrest-api-direct.html`**
   - Tests direct REST API calls
   - Tests Supabase JS client
   - Checks all table accessibility
   - Auto-runs on page load

### How to Test

1. Open `test-postgrest-api-direct.html` in your browser
2. It will automatically run 3 tests:
   - Direct REST API call to `/rest/v1/drugs`
   - Supabase JS client query
   - Check all tables (drugs, programs, drugs_programs, users)

3. Expected Results:
   - ✅ All tests should return data
   - ✅ Status 200 for all requests
   - ❌ If still 404: PostgREST cache hasn't refreshed yet

## ⏱️ Wait Time

PostgREST schema cache refresh in Supabase Cloud can take:
- **Immediate**: If migration triggers reload (what we attempted)
- **1-5 minutes**: Normal propagation time
- **Up to 10 minutes**: In rare cases during high load

## 🔄 If Still Not Working

### Option 1: Wait and Retry
The cache refresh is asynchronous. Wait 2-3 minutes and test again with `test-postgrest-api-direct.html`.

### Option 2: Manual Cache Refresh
In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to Project Settings
2. Click "Restart project" or "Pause/Resume"
3. This forces all services to restart with fresh cache

### Option 3: Use Edge Function (Workaround)
If PostgREST cache is stuck, we can create an Edge Function that queries the database directly, bypassing PostgREST's REST API.

## 📊 Current Status

- ✅ Database table exists and has data
- ✅ RLS policies configured correctly
- ✅ Permissions granted properly
- ⏳ Waiting for PostgREST cache to refresh
- 🧪 Test with `test-postgrest-api-direct.html`

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for cache to propagate
2. **Open `test-postgrest-api-direct.html`** to verify API access
3. **If tests pass**: Search functionality will work immediately
4. **If tests fail**: Let me know and I'll implement an Edge Function workaround

The database is correctly configured. This is purely a PostgREST caching issue that should resolve within a few minutes.
