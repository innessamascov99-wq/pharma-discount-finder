# Search Fix Complete - Final Solution

## Root Cause Identified

The search functionality was failing with "Failed to fetch" errors because the `db-query` Edge Function was configured with `verifyJWT: true`, which required authentication tokens. However, the search feature needs to work for unauthenticated (anonymous) users browsing the site.

## Issues Found

1. **Edge Function JWT Verification**: The `db-query` function had `verifyJWT: true`
2. **Database Access**: Data exists (40 drugs, 40 programs) and RLS policies are correctly configured for anonymous access
3. **Frontend Code**: Working correctly, calling the Edge Function properly

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Redeployed Edge Function
- Updated `db-query` Edge Function with `verifyJWT: false`
- This allows anonymous users to call the search function
- RLS policies on the database still enforce security (only active records visible)

### 2. Database Status
- **Drugs Table**: 40 active records (Ozempic, Mounjaro, Trulicity, etc.)
- **Programs Table**: 40 active records
- **RLS Policies**: Properly configured for anonymous SELECT access on active records

### 3. Edge Function Capabilities
The `db-query` function supports:
- `search_drugs` - Search medications by name, generic name, drug class, indication
- `search_programs` - Search assistance programs
- `get_all_drugs` - Get all active drugs
- `get_all_programs` - Get all active programs
- `get_drug_by_id` - Get specific drug
- `get_program_by_id` - Get specific program
- `get_programs_for_drug` - Get programs for a drug
- `get_drugs_by_manufacturer` - Filter by manufacturer
- `get_programs_by_manufacturer` - Filter programs by manufacturer

## Security Notes

- Edge Function uses Service Role Key internally for database access
- RLS policies restrict anonymous users to viewing only `active = true` records
- No sensitive data is exposed through the search
- CORS properly configured for web access

## Test Results

- Database connectivity: ✅ Working
- Data availability: ✅ 40 drugs, 40 programs
- RLS policies: ✅ Anonymous read access configured
- Edge Function deployment: ✅ Deployed without JWT verification
- Build: ✅ Successful

## How Search Works Now

1. User enters search query on website (no login required)
2. Frontend calls `https://nuhfqkhplldontxtoxkg.supabase.co/functions/v1/db-query`
3. Edge Function uses Service Role Key to query database
4. RLS policies ensure only active records are returned
5. Results displayed to user

## Next Steps

The search should now work for all users, including anonymous visitors. Test by:
1. Opening the website
2. Entering a medication name (e.g., "ozempic", "insulin", "diabetes")
3. Viewing search results

If any issues persist, check browser console for detailed error messages.
